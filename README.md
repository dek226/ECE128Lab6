# The purpose of this latch, flip flop, counter, clock divider lab is to get accustomed to Verilog coding and how embedded systems store information in the Vivado environment. Another purpose is to provide more modular programming practice through instantiation and utilization of many components/modules. Then design a test bench utilizing the looping techniques learned in class for efficiency and better practice, and learn how to display the different modules wires from the top level unexpanded view in the waveform.
